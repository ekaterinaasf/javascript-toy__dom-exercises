# DOM Atomic 01: Show One Element

## Questions

---

> If you click the link to reveal more text and then refresh the page, does the text remain revealed, or is it hidden again? Why?

No, it's with the default style.

---

> Remove `window.addEventListener("load", function(){` (and the closing `})`) from **global.js**. Does the link still reveal the text? What is the purpose of this code that you've removed?

No, this is the code to make hidden text visible.

> Describe the the `addEventListener` method. (Remember that there is a specific, technical, methodical way to describe methods. Your reply should match that format.)

It takes the element and apply for predefined event mentioned function.
